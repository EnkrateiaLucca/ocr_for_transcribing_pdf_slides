Partially ObservableEnvironments
Partial observabilitv:agent indirectly observes environment:
Arobot with cameravision isnttold its absolutelocation
A tradingagent onlv observes current prices
Apoker playing agent only observes public cards
Now agent state≠environment state
Formally this isapartially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP)
Agent must construct its own state representation S,e.g.
Complete history: S
Beliefs of environment state: S= (P[Sg = s.mPS9 = s)
Recurrent neural network: S=c(S +O.Yo)
